## Why I made this site

This project was made to showcase my skills using third-party APIs. Through this Weather Dashboard, I was able to utilize my knowledge of third party APIs to obtain and utilize the Open Weather API to collect data from their site to use for my own project. Upon visiting this webpage, the user will be able to search up a city and they will be shown with the current weather of that location and the next five day forecast as well. Once a city is searched, a button will be created to show the history of where they search that, upon being clicked, will go back and show the waether for that previous location.

## What I learned

I laerned through this project how to properly utilize third party APIs and how to properly implement them in my projects. Further usage of "fetch" gave me better understanding of how to properly call certain APIs correctly and how to obtain their data and use it for my own projects. Creating multiple functions and correctly calling them further helped me with my growth and comfortability in creating and correctly calling functions. Lastly, this project helped me get more comfortbale with utilizing web APIs which is critical in helping make all my projects operational and increasdily more user friendly and fun to use.

## Challenges 

One huge problem I had endured through this project was how to properly grab the info from the open weather API and use it within my code. While it took considerable research to get a better grasp of how to utilize fetch and what parameters were needed to obtain the data I needed, I eventually become comfortable with fetch and have become more knowledgable with using third party APIs.
